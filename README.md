## Solution Proposed 

Using ML 
  1. Load the data from database
  2. Perform EDA and feature engineering
  3. Fit the ML Classification and find out which one performs better
  4. Select the top few and tune hyperparameters
  5. Select the best model based on desired metrics


## Code flow 

### Set up.py 
Setup.py will find out the constructor file in each and every folder and wherever the constructor is available , it will create a local package 
- e . - it will loook for Set up.py and than all the folders will be executed as the local folder
- 

## DB Setup 

1.Mongo DB Setup 
2.Storing Data to Mongo DB
